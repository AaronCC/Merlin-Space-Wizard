Merlin,SirPercival
Greetings, Sir Percival.
Good to see you alive Merlin. Is there no end to Morgana's evil horde?
It does seem hopeless and I am weary, but we must go on.
And go on we will. I found this strange scroll on the corpse of one of my foes, perhaps you can use it.-<Recieved Item: ManaBall Scroll>
Many thanks Sir Percival.
