Merlin,KingArthur
You called me my king?
Yes, Merlin. Morgana has ammassed an army and discovered the coordinates of station Camelot, their arrival is imminent. I have asked the other knights of the round command center to help fight them off, but I need your powerful magics if we are to be successful. Will you help us, Merlin?
It would be my honour! Morgana's evil minions will be ash in my wake.
Then so it shall be! I've told the other knights that if they should see you, to give you a gift to help in the coming battles.
